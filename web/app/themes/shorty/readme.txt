Description: Shorty has a pull down menu for navigation which requires tapping or clicking on an icon to open the menu. Same with the sidebar, it is just a short little tab that leaves all the attention to your blog articles or images on your page. Shorty menu navigation and sidebar widget area can become very large, so do not let the name fool you! Custom Background but no custom header support due to the absolute positioning required to make the Shorty tabs work correctly in all browsers and media formats. Responsive but and liquid, (fluid width content but also changes to your device screen size). Translation ready.
